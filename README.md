# INFOTC-1600-Markdown-Challenge

Welcome to the homepage of my INFOTC-1600 submission. 

***
###Here are some interesting things you can do with markdown:


###Create a list!
- A list can be unordered
- With as many unordered entries as you desire...
- One
- Two
- Three


###There are also ordered lists!
1. Ordered lists are - well - ordered! 
2. Each entry of the list will be ordered
3. Both list types may be useful for different scenarios.


Feel free to make your text **bold**, *italic*, or even ***both at once***.
